Analyzing suicide statistics involves several steps to understand the trends and patterns in the data. Here's a detailed approach:

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is clean and formatted correctly. Handling the missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculating basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range to understand the central tendency and spread of the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and line graphs to explore the data. Looking for trends, seasonal patterns, and any significant variations over time.

Regression Analysis: Using regression analysis to model the relationship between suicide numbers and other variables.

ANOVA Analysis: Using it to analyse the differences between suicide number and other variables.
